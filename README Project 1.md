**Project1:** **Data** **Acquisition,** **Cleaning,** **Preprocessing**
**andFeature** **Engineering** **for** **Exploratory** **Analysis**

**Project** **Overview**

In this project, you will acquire data from various sources and perform
essential data preparation tasks, including cleaning, exploratory data
analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and feature engineering.The final
deliverable will be a well-documented reportsummarizing the findings and
methodology. The objective is to gain hands-on experience in handling
real-world data challenges and deriving meaningful insights.

Theproject will help youunderstand the complete datapipeline,fromraw
datacollection to generating actionable insights. It will provide
opportunities to work with different data sources, tackle real-world
inconsistencies, and implement industry-standard techniques for
datapreprocessingand feature engineering. By engaging in this project,
youwill improve your ability to communicate data-driven results
effectively and gain practical knowledge applicable to various domains
in data science and analytics.

Youare encouraged to be creative in yourdataselection
andanalysisapproaches.Thefinal report should not only highlight
technical work but also showcase the significance of the findings and
how they can be utilized in decision-making or further predictive
modeling tasks.

**Project** **Tasks**

**1.** **Data** **Acquisition**

> You must obtain a dataset from one or more of the following sources
> (using multiple sources/files is highly encouraged):
>
> • Public data repositories (e.g.,Kaggle; see Lecture 01 for the full
> list) • Web scraping (e.g.,using rvest, BeuatifulSoap, Selenium, etc.)
>
> • APIs (e.g., Twitter API, OpenWeather API, Census API,etc.) • Other
> open-access sources

**2.** **Data** **Cleaning** **and** **Handling** **Inconsistencies**

> • Detect and rectify data inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect data types,
> inconsistent labels, etc.)
>
> • Ensureuniform formatting across variables • Addressduplicate
> dataentries
>
> • Identify and handle outliers
>
> • Identify and handle missing values using appropriate techniques
> (imputation, removal, etc.)

**3.** **Exploratory** **Data** **Analysis** **(EDA)**

> • Generate summary statistics and descriptive insights • Visualize
> distributions, relationships, and trends
>
> • Identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies • Provide initial
> interpretations of data insights

**4.** **Data** **Preprocessing** **and** **Feature** **Engineering**

> • Normalize/standardize numerical variables asneeded • Encode
> categorical variables appropriately
>
> • Create meaningful new features that could improve the dataset’s
> usability • Justify preprocessing steps taken

**5.** **Report** **Preparation**

> • Document all stepstaken in
> dataacquisition,cleaning,EDA,preprocessing,and feature engineering
>
> • Present insights usingwell-structured visualizations and
> explanations

1\. **Dataset**: Theraw andfinal clean, processed datasets (these
filescan be submitted in a GitHub repository).

2\. **Code** **Files**: A well-commented Python and/or R script(s)
containing the full workflow (these files should be submitted in a
GitHub repository with proper documentation; include a README file
withinstructions on how to run the code).

3\. **Report**: A structured report in Quarto/RMarkdown (converted into
a PDF file) that includes

> • Introduction and dataset description • Data acquisition methodology

> • Cleaningand preprocessing steps • Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
>
> • Feature engineering process and justification • Summary of key
> findings
>
> • Challenges faced and future recommendations
>
> • LinktoyourGitHub repository.Make sure itispublicandthat I can
> accessall the filesstored init. Ifpreferred,you canaddmetothe
> listoftherepository members (ap4347)
>
> • Each member’s contribution to the project

You must submit the report on Courseworks (one member of a team can
submit the report on behalf of the team).
